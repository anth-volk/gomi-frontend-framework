# Gomi
Gomi is a JavaScript front-end framework (or maybe library?) modelled on React, but intended to allow for quick and easy scaffolding for basic Android apps that follow Google's Material UI's Material 3 design standards, available [here](https://m3.material.io).

**Please note:** This framework is being created for learning purposes, and as such, should be used at *your own risk*. Let the name of the package (*trash* in Japanese) be a warning.
